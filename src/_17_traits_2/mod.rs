/**
=== SETTER & GETTER ===

An associated constant is a constant declared within the trait.
A constant is a name for a fixed, immutable value.

 - The same concept and flexibility than fn attached to traits

At start, we can't use property that we are not sure about will be implemented in every case:
For example:
```
trait Taxable {
    ...
    self.amount -> exists if we declare a enum with the trait Taxable or a struct without amount property? No
    ...
```
 - Solution -> Getter method, retrieves a piece of data. It 'gets' a piece of state. Traits supports it
The traits cannot guarantee fields, but can guarantee methods -> "fn amount..." === "self.amount" NO / "self.amount()" YES

But we get an abstract value forma  function, and we cant overwrite the real property. What if we want to duplicate the amount property? -> Setter
 - Setter is a method that writes a piece of data. It "sets" a piece of state


=== SUPERTRAITS ===

 - Trait from which another trait inherits functionality.
 - The parent is called the supertrait and the child is called de subtrait.
 - Any type that implements a subtrait must implement its supertrait.
